This GitHub action allows you to instrument a pipeline and track number of runs and their duration; the data is then exported to a prometheus aggregation gateway, like [prom-aggregation-gateway](https://github.com/zapier/prom-aggregation-gateway).
Due to limitations of GitHub actions, tracking success rate is only possible via api, so it is outside the scope of this action (for now).

## Usage

Just add the action as a step to your job, and provide the url of the prometheus aggregation gateway as an input:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: autometrics-dev/instrument-pipeline@v1
    with:
      pushgateway: http://pushgateway.example.com/metrics
  - uses: actions/checkout@v3
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
    with:
      node-version: 20
  - run: npm install
  - run: npm run build
```

Now every time the action runs, it will send the duration (and increase the run counter) of the run to the aggregation gateway.

## Inputs

### `pushgateway`

**Required** The url of the prometheus aggregation gateway, with the `/metrics` endpoint.

### `buckets`

Array of buckets to use for the histogram. For example, `[0, 1, 2, 5, 10, +Infinity]`.
